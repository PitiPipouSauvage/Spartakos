#### Project presentation: 

    The Spartakos project aims to make an easy server to server interaction system.
    For instance the Spartakos project contains a app installation system with the
    setup of an 'app store' server that contains all the files and folders and can
    on a simple request allow another server to download one of his apps.
    Note: this project is still in pre-Alpha and does not contain all of its 
    final features. This project is designed to be part of other projects so it is not a standalone even though it can work fine alone.
